rohans-cypher is an encryption program in pre-alpha released under GPL 3.0 Copyright (C) 2015  Jeremy Benz


How to use this program:  (it really isn't useful yet)
from the command line/terminal in the folder you saved rohans-cypher to enter the following commands


ruby -v (to make sure you have ruby installed. if this errors check youtube for a tutorial)
ruby rohans-cypher

--encrypt <message> <encryption key>
--decrypt <message> <encryption key>


message and encryption key should have 'marks' around them
for troubleshooting add -V as the second argument
IE
--encrypt -V <message> <encryption key>



Planned features:
encryption and decryption by command line
encryption by command line working, decryption broken.  (something to do with outputing an array, and getting a string back)


long term project goals:

refactor as a sub class of string
make a gem with the same functionality
